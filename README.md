# Software Testing/QA Test

This is a 2 part test exam to be done as part of the recruitment process at Net Tech International.

The test has a time to completion of **7 days** after the initial email is sent by one of our members.

**IMPORTANT: THE COMPLETION OF THIS TEST DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT A CANDIDATE WILL GET HIRED**

### Test 1- Manual

The test 1 consists of a basic **test process and documentation**.

Here is the scenario and context:
- There's an APP already up & running in production being used by N amount of users. An invoice/quoting system.
- You just started working with the company. First QA in the development department.
- There's little or no documentation of the application, business logic, previous tests.
- The application (for example purposes) to be used is: https://www.fusioninvoice.com/ 

#### Requirements
1. Log into the demo.
2. Take 2 modules (preferably New Client form and Invoices).
3. Write a basic test plan for the testing of these 2 modules.
4. Write at least 6 test cases for these 2 modules. Meaning 3 test cases each module. 
5. Determine, based on your expertise and looking at the whole application, at least 10 cases that should be part of regression testing. (This can be just mentioning them, not as a full test-case look and feel format).

#### Bonus Points
In order for you to get more points on this test, you have the **option** to perform **one or more** of the following additional tasks which would get you **more points** and therefore better chances:

1. Include other modules in the test cases document (please limit the test cases to 5 per module).
2. Load and performance testing (be careful with this since it is a third-party app).
3. Make suggestions on what would you change to the app from both UI and process stand point.


### Test 2 - Manual
The test 2 consists of a basic **UI/Process review**.

Here is the scenario and context:
- A Product Owner comes to you and asks you to review couple of screens of an application that is up and running and being used by N amount of users. A CRM system.
- The enhancement is currently in staging. 
- The latest enhancement was done by the developers, but something looks 'weird' to the Product Owner.
- The application (for example purposes) to be used is: https://www.espocrm.com/

#### Requirements
1. Log into the demo as administrator.
2. Spot what doesn't look 'right' in the application (from the Dashboard section) or that could be improved for a better UI/UX.

Please note that a lot of elements in applications or processes are subjective, what is good for someone doesn't mean is actually good for the end-user. There are UI/UX principles that are based on what's best for the end-user.


### Submission

In order for the submission of the test to be successful you need to reply to the email with the documents attached to it. 


**IMPORTANT**
- **The 2 applications above were not created by NTI. These are live demos of real applications being used out there**
- **As a common practice, try to make your documentation as friendly as possible. We might assign someone who's not technical to review it**
- **Documentation is very important to us**
